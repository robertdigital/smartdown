## Release History

- **1.0.0** - First public open source release of Smartdown, after too many years and 118 private releases. Huzzah!
- **1.0.1** - Delete LICENSE in favor of LICENSE.md. Eliminate duplicate FAQ from README.md. Replace references to smartdown.site with smartdown.github.io/smartdown (deprecating smartdown.site). Replace references to doctorbud.com/smartdown/ with smartdown.github.io/smartdown (deprecating doctorbud.com/smartdown/). Use smartdown@quantumclay.com for email feedback. Eliminated duplicate of README that was in doc/index.md.
- **1.0.2** - Add support to starter.js for loading multicards and jumping to a specific card in a multicard document. Create a single-file example in SimpleSiteExample/index_unpkg.html, which refers to unpkg.com to satisfy smartdown and gallery resources. Fix starter.js so that it can handle Gists properly even when the card hash is an external URL.
