## Frequently Asked Questions

- **Is this Beta Software?** Not anymore. We're calling it 1.0.0 and saying it is ready for others to use. It has been in use for a couple years internally with the Smartdown team.
- **Is this open source?** Yes, finally. As of April 28, 2019 Smartdown has been released as open source under the BSD-3-Clause license.
- **How are you going to make a living off of this?** I have no idea! Smartdown is something I want to exist. I'm hoping that someone else finds it useful and that maybe there will be a way for me to keep working on it. Right now, it's a weekend and spare time project.
- **How can I provide feedback?** - Send an email to [smartdown@quantumclay.com](mailto:smartdown@quantumclay.com); any feedback is appreciated. I am working on creating a more flexible and interactive means of user feedback.
- **What is InfoClay?** InfoClay is the name of an interactive authoring environment wherein Smartdown was initially conceived, and then isolated as a separate library. InfoClay is still under development as [KnowBench](https://knowbench.com), but my priorities have been on stabilizing and releasing Smartdown. In some of the earlier documentation and examples, InfoClay and Smartdown mean the same thing: markdown-based, interactive, reactive explorable explanations.
